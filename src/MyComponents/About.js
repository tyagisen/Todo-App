        The Poetry Translation Centre is very proud to partner with the Aké Arts
        and Books Festival to present a special series of translation workshops
        on the Nigerian languages of Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa. Join like-minded
        poetry lovers from across the world to discover new poetry and different
        cultures, share insights and language skills, working together to open
        up a poem in its original language and reassemble it in English. The
        result will be new group translations of contemporary Nigerian poems by
        Oladapo Olatubosun, Auwalu Anwar and Amarachi Attamah. To help in this
        task you will be guided by a translator who is an expert in the language
        that is the focus for that session, and a professional poet. They will
        offer insight into the nuances of the language and culture, and give
        helpful suggestions for the direction of the translation that is
        produced. Taking place online via Google Meet, the workshops are the
        perfect way to keep yourself feeling creative, engaged and connected to
        the world at large. A rough and ready guide translation is provided by
        the guest translator so there is no need to know the language being
        translated – simply sign up and bring your love of poetry and language.
        Three 90 minutes sessions focussing on a poem in each language will take
        place on Thursday 22 October 2020: Yoruba language workshop on the
        poetry of Oladapo Olatubosun: 10:00-11:30 Hausa language workshop on the
        poetry of Auwalu Anwar: 12:30-14:00 Igbo language workshop on the poetry
        of Amarachi Attamah: 15:00-16:30
